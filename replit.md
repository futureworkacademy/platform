# The Future of Work - Business Simulation Game

## Overview
A web-based business simulation game designed for graduate students to make strategic company decisions over a semester-long period. Teams navigate the challenges of AI adoption while managing employee anxiety about job displacement, competing to achieve the best outcomes across financial performance and cultural health metrics.

## Key Features
- **Executive Dashboard**: Real-time company metrics including revenue, employees, morale, and budgets
- **Weekly Intelligence Briefings**: Curated articles with strategic insights for decision-making
- **AI Deployment Decisions**: Deploy AI/ML across departments with risk/reward tradeoffs
- **Resource Allocation**: Invest in lobbying and employee reskilling programs
- **People Analytics**: Deep insights into employee sentiment, behavior trends, and key issues
- **Competition Leaderboard**: Team rankings by financial and cultural performance scores

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter routing, TanStack Query
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI, Radix primitives, Recharts for data visualization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Backend**: Express.js with in-memory storage
- **Fonts**: IBM Plex Sans, Inter, Roboto Mono

## Game Mechanics
1. Each week, teams receive an intelligence briefing with articles
2. Global events may occur with positive/negative impacts
3. Teams allocate resources: AI deployment, lobbying, reskilling
4. Performance tracked via dual scoring:
   - **Financial Score**: Revenue × Workforce ratio
   - **Cultural Score**: Employee morale/sentiment
   - **Combined Score**: Financial × Cultural

## Running the Application
The application runs via the "Start application" workflow which executes `npm run dev`, starting both the Express backend and Vite frontend on port 5000.

## Development Preview Note
**Important**: The Replit embedded webview (preview pane) does not work with session-based authentication. This is a known browser security limitation - the webview runs in an iframe, and modern browsers block third-party cookies in iframes by default.

**To test the app during development:**
- Click "Open in new tab" in the webview toolbar to open in an external browser
- Or use a private/incognito browser window with the app URL
- The webview will show a blank screen or fail to maintain login sessions

This applies to any Replit app using OIDC authentication or session cookies. Once published/deployed, the app works normally in all browsers.

## Recent Changes
- Initial MVP implementation (January 2026)
- Bloomberg Terminal inspired design with Shadcn components
- Full simulation loop: Dashboard → Briefing → Decisions → Analytics → Leaderboard
- Dark mode support
- Added Replit Auth integration with OIDC for school email authentication (January 2026)
- Implemented admin-controlled team management system:
  - Users cannot self-register to teams
  - Admin assigns users to teams via /api/admin/assign-team
  - Users table has teamId (nullable) and isAdmin fields
- Created waiting assignment page for authenticated users without team assignment
- Protected all game routes with isAuthenticated middleware
- Each user sees only their assigned team's game data
- **Enhanced Multi-Attribute Decision System** (January 2026):
  - Week 1: Automation Strategy (intensity sliders, debt/reskilling budgets, timeline/communication selects)
  - Week 2: Talent Development (hiring budgets, dual career track toggle, job guarantee sliders)
  - Week 3: Union Relations (wage increase sliders, worker council toggle, communication budget)
  - 15 Easter eggs detect specific research statistics (72%, AutoTech, TechnoForge, etc.) for bonus points
  - Simulation config for admin to toggle individual/team/hybrid competition modes
  - Admin analytics dashboard with player performance tracking and easter egg detection rates
- **Activity Logging System** (January 2026):
  - Tracks key events: team_created, user_assigned, week_advanced, enhanced_decision_submitted
  - Supports filtering by eventType, userId, teamId, and date range
  - Export to CSV or JSON formats for analysis
