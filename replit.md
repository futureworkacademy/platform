# The Future of Work - Business Simulation Game

## Overview
A web-based business simulation game designed for graduate students to make strategic company decisions over a semester-long period. Teams navigate the challenges of AI adoption while managing employee anxiety about job displacement, competing to achieve the best outcomes across financial performance and cultural health metrics.

## Key Features
- **Executive Dashboard**: Real-time company metrics including revenue, employees, morale, and budgets
- **Weekly Intelligence Briefings**: Curated articles with strategic insights for decision-making
- **AI Deployment Decisions**: Deploy AI/ML across departments with risk/reward tradeoffs
- **Resource Allocation**: Invest in lobbying and employee reskilling programs
- **People Analytics**: Deep insights into employee sentiment, behavior trends, and key issues
- **Competition Leaderboard**: Team rankings by financial and cultural performance scores

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter routing, TanStack Query
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI, Radix primitives, Recharts for data visualization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Backend**: Express.js with in-memory storage
- **Fonts**: IBM Plex Sans, Inter, Roboto Mono

## Game Mechanics
1. Each week, teams receive an intelligence briefing with articles
2. Global events may occur with positive/negative impacts
3. Teams allocate resources: AI deployment, lobbying, reskilling
4. Performance tracked via dual scoring:
   - **Financial Score**: Revenue × Workforce ratio
   - **Cultural Score**: Employee morale/sentiment
   - **Combined Score**: Financial × Cultural

## Running the Application
The application runs via the "Start application" workflow which executes `npm run dev`, starting both the Express backend and Vite frontend on port 5000.

## Development Preview Note
**Important**: The Replit embedded webview (preview pane) does not work with session-based authentication. This is a known browser security limitation - the webview runs in an iframe, and modern browsers block third-party cookies in iframes by default.

**To test the app during development:**
- Click "Open in new tab" in the webview toolbar to open in an external browser
- Or use a private/incognito browser window with the app URL
- The webview will show a blank screen or fail to maintain login sessions

This applies to any Replit app using OIDC authentication or session cookies. Once published/deployed, the app works normally in all browsers.

## Authentication Flow
The app uses Replit Auth (OIDC). When users click "Sign In":
1. They're redirected to Replit's login consent page
2. **Important**: Users must click "Continue with Google", "Continue with Apple", or "Continue with email" - NOT the "Log in secured by Replit" text at the bottom (that's just branding that links to replit.com)
3. After authenticating, users are redirected back to the app
4. New users without team assignments see a "Waiting for Team Assignment" page
5. Admins can assign users to teams via the Admin panel

## Recent Changes

  - Update member roles via PATCH /api/class-admin/organizations/:orgId/members/:memberId/role
  - Remove members via DELETE /api/class-admin/organizations/:orgId/members/:memberId
  - Role validation allowlist prevents privilege escalation (only STUDENT and CLASS_ADMIN allowed)
